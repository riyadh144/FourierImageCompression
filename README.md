# FourierImageCompression

University days hobby project I worked on with my roommate and friend Mahmoud Nimer

I found the source code and I thought it is worth to share on github.

It is an immage compression using fourier transform.
Where you try to approximate the image as a an fourier equation and you calculate the pixels based on the generated formula.

I haven't tested it in years, so if you need it working hit me up
